# Assignments & Grading
Students will be graded in six areas: Pre-Program Survey, Labs/Google Classroom Assignments, Participation, Attendance,	Post-Program Survey, and Final Project

## Pre-Program Survey
The pre-program survey is needed from all learners and counts for 1/5 of your final grade. The link to the survey can be found <a href="https://corexmsp4sy8p6bphbs3.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9RyPK8ZrD0iak0C">here</a>.

## Labs/Google Classroom Assignments
Exit tickets must be submitted after each lecture session.

## Participation
Participation is essential to the Hack the Hood experience and will be evaluated by your instructors. Examples of poor participation are: Camera always off, not contributing to team building exercises, not offering solutions to group coding sessions, etc.

## Attendance
Attendance is crucial to staying in the Hustle program. More than three unexcused absences may result in the removal of a student from the program. Please reach out to your instructor before a missed session to make sure the appropriate notes are added to the attendance sheet.

## Post-Program Survey
The post-program survey is needed from all learners. The survey will be released in the last month of the Hustle program.

## Final Project
Once the asynchronous period starts, learners will meet with their project group and instructor once a week to finish their final project (each group will choose the days and times). There will be NO lectures or regular Tiger Team sessions. The final project counts for 1/5 of your final grade.
